# Quick APK Building Guide

Since Java is not installed on your system, here are the quickest ways to build your APK:

## Option 1: Install Android Studio (Recommended)

1. **Download Android Studio**:
   - Visit [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
   - Click "Download Android Studio"
   - Follow installation instructions

2. **Open your project**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\Janjua\Desktop\app` and open it

3. **Build the APK**:
   - Click on "Build" in the top menu
   - Select "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" 
   - Choose "Build APK(s)"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Android Studio will show a notification with a link to the APK location

## Option 2: Install JDK Only (Faster but more technical)

1. **Download Adoptium JDK**:
   - Visit [https://adoptium.net/](https://adoptium.net/)
   - Download the latest JDK for Windows
   - Run the installer (accept default options)

2. **Set environment variables**:
   - After installation, right-click "This PC" and select "Properties"
   - Click "Advanced system settings"
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under System Variables, click "New"
   - Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
   - Variable value: Path to your JDK (typically `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.X.X.X-hotspot`)
   - Click OK
   - Find "Path" in System Variables, select it and click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
   - Click OK on all dialog boxes

3. **Run the build script**:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Navigate to your project: `cd C:\Users\Janjua\Desktop\app`
   - Run the build command: `.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug`
   - Find the APK at: `C:\Users\Janjua\Desktop\app\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`

## Option 3: Use APK Build Service (If other options don't work)

If you're unable to install software, you could use an online APK build service by zipping your project and uploading it. However, this isn't recommended for privacy and security reasons.
